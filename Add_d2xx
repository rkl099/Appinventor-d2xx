To include d2xx to appinventor

This work was done to resolve the “Java Lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of Lcom/ftdi/j2xx/D2xxManager”
when using an FTDI adapter with appinventor. It only adds d2xx in an extension to the same code used for
the built in serial component. See: https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/t/using-serial-with-ftdi/14136

(The later SerialOTG extension resolves many problems with the built in serial component and adds new functions.
 It also adds more adapters but no FTDI specific functions )

How to:

copy d2xx.jar to appinventor/lib/physicaloid

in appinventor/components/build.xml

after the following line:
    <copy toFile="${public.deps.dir}/physicaloid.jar" file="${lib.dir}/physicaloid/physicaloid-library.jar" />
add this line    
    <copy toFile="${public.deps.dir}/d2xx.jar" file="${lib.dir}/physicaloid/d2xx.jar" />


se NewSerial.java how to make an extension with physicaloid.jar and d2xx.jar
Add this file to .../runtime 


d2xx.jar can be found here: (but maybe not the one I have tested)
